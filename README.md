## Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on my pet homelab project
* Rediscovering my lost computer, networking, server skills
    - DOS 3.1 to Windows 11, Desktops and Server, Home and Pro, Enterprise
    - Active Directory, YP (NIS), LDAP
* Learning more recent technologies including
    - Containers and Virtualization: Docker, Kubernetes, Hypervisors/VMs
    - Networks and FWs: nftables, networkd, etc
* Realizing why i loved vim, but finding I now have a lot of :wq in my documents when using GUI text editors 😄

🤔 My IT background goes way further back than [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markaclem) shows

😄 Pronouns: he/him
